Priorities:
	- If A full row can be acheived, do it
	- Strategy changes based on how much of the board is full (go for more rows when empty, go for survival when near full
	- possibly use drop shadows to predict outcomes
	- need pattern recognition
	- possibly include a delay to slow the AI down so if it runs to fast to see
	- seperate placement solutions for empty boards
