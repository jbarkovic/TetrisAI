 *  a call back to occur even though the interface may be aware of the need to 
 *  update the screen already, in this case just ignore the call back to avaoid 
 *  updating the screen needlessly)
 *  ringBell() is called only by the Tetris Engine, It is the job of the
 *  interface developer to ensure this method reaches their interface.
 *  Either insert a method call into this code, or extend the class and 
 *  override the method.
